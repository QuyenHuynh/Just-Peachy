* On load, you are given information on an activity including description, address, and main website link.
* If you happen to not be interested, click on the "next" button to view the next activity.
* The app also uses Open Weather API to display the weather and Google API to provide a visual display of the location.

Deployed on Heroku: https://justpeachy.herokuapp.com/
